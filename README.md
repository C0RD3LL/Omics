# Omics

`RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq)` has a wide variety of applications, but no one, single analysis pipeline can be used in all cases. This repository started as a scrapbook of omics projects but has changed into a review all of the major steps in RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design, quality control, read alignment, quantification of gene and transcript levels, visualization, differential gene expression, alternative splicing, functional analysis, gene fusion detection and eQTL mapping, highlight the challenges associated with each step. Hopeuflly I will include  the analysis of small RNAs and the integration of RNA-seq with other functional genomics techniques.
